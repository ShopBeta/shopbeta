                                             There are several scenarios in which orders may not be able to be processed. An order may be refused or canceled for any reason at any given time, and the Site reserves the right to do so. In order to process an order, we may ask you to provide supplementary information or verification, and this may include, but is not limited to, a phone number or address; we reserve the right to only process the order after any such requested information is provided.
                                             In addition, we reserve the right to verify your payment details and personal information shared with us before delivering the product to you, in order to avoid any credit or debit card fraud. This verification process may require checking your identity, place of residence or banking details. In any such verification process, if sufficient answers are not received, or if we suspect any fraudulent use of bank cards, we reserve the right to automatically cancel your order.
                                             At ShopBeta we are dedicated to ensuring accuracy in the pricing information shown on the Site, but reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order in cases where a pricing error has occurred. In such an event when an item’s price may have been displayed incorrectly, we may, at our own discretion, either cancel the order and notify you as such, or contact you for further instructions. The right to cancel an order or refuse it applies even if the order has been confirmed and a charge made to your bank card.
